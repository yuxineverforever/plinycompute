# This file contains the IP addresses of the worker nodes in a standalone
# cluster of PlinyCompute.

# In standalone mode, PlinyCompute simulates a cluster running the manger node,
# and one or more worker nodes as separate processes in the same machine,
# e.g. a laptop. This is useful for testing and getting familiar with the system.

# Add one IP address per line, with the format localhost:XXXX, replacing
# XXXX with a different port for each separate worker node.

# In this example, PlinyCompute is launched with one manager node, and one 
# worker node (listening on port 8109). 

localhost:8109
