/**
 * This is the class that implements PC's per-node storage manager.
 *
 * There are two types of pages. Anonymous and non-anonymous. Anonymous pages don't correspond to a disk
 * page; they are pages used as RAM for temporary storage.  They remain in existence until all handles to
 * them are gone, at which time they disappear.  However, anonymous pages can be swapped out of RAM by
 * the storage manager, so it is possible to have more anonymous pages than can fit in the physical RAM
 * of the machine.
 *
 * Non-anonymous pages correspond to data that are stored on disk for later use.
 *
 * Pages by default are pageSize in bytes.  But, as an optimization, they can be smaller than this as
 * well.  There are two ways to get a smaller page.  One can simply create a small anonymous page by
 * calling getPage (maxBytes) which returns a page that may be as small as maxBytes in size.
 *
 * The other way is to call freezeSize (numBytes), which tells the storage manager that the page is never
 * going to use more than the first numBytes bytes on the page.  freezeSize () can be used on both
 * anonymous and non-anonymous pages.
 *
 * Because the actual pages are variable sized, we don't figure out where in a file a non-anonymous page
 * is going to be written until it is unpinned (at which time its size cannot change).
 *
 * When a page is created, it is pinned.  It is kept in RAM until it is unpinned (a page can be unpinned
 * manually, or because there are no more handles in scope).  When a page is unpinned, it is assumed that
 * the page is read only, forever after.  Later it can be pinned again, but it is still read-only.
 *
 * At sometime before a page is unpinned, one can call freezeSize () on a handle to the page, informing
 * the system that not all of the bytes on the page are going to be used.  The system can then store only
 * the first, used part of the page, at great savings.
 *
 * When a large page is broken up into mini-pages, we keep track of how many mini-pages are pinned, and we
 * keep references to all of those mini-pages on the page.  As long as some mini-page on the page is pinned,
 * the entire page is pinned.  Once it contains no pinned mini-pages, it can potentially be re-cycled (and
 * all of the un-pinned mini-pages written back to disk).
 *
 * When a non-anonymous page is unpinned for the first time, we determine its true location on disk (pages
 * may not be located sequentially on disk, due to the fact that we have variable-sized pages, and we do
 * not know at the outset the actual number of bytes that will be used by a page).
 *
 * An anonymous page gets its location the first time that it is written out to disk.
 *
 * A page can be dirty or not dirty.  All pages are dirty at creation, but then once they are written out
 * to disk, they are clean forever more (by definition, a page needs to be unpinned to be written out to
 * disk, but once it is unpinned, it cannot be modified, so after it is written back, it can never be
 * modified again).
