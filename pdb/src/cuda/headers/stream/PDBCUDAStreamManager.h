     * The design principle for StreamUtil is mainly serving for PDB worker thread.
     * Based on the fact that, we dont have ability to explicit add cuda barrier/sync methanism to PDB.
     * It is better to keep the each PDB worker thread only mapped to one cuda stream. So that a thread can only manipulate one stream and push all the operations to that stream.
     * This can make sure that, there is no need to explicit sync between stream. (e.g. one stream for a different UDF)
